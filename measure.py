"""
Phase B measurement driver — read the numbers before writing any rule.

PROPOSAL-II asks for exactly this before Phase D: "Run against twenty real
technologies and read the numbers before writing a single revision rule or
threshold." Two of the five proposed revision rules are expected to prove
worthless and one unanticipated rule to prove essential, and the cheapest place
to learn that is here rather than in a crawler that already depends on them.

What it measures, per technology:

  * resolution — did `resolve()` find it at all, from which lap, at what cost.
    The success rate over a list like this is the direct measurement of F6.
  * extraction — for a sample of pages: which CONTENT selector won, how often
    nothing won and <body> was taken whole, how many templates a site really
    has, how much of the "documentation" is link text, and how many pages are
    JS shells.

It stores nothing in the knowledge base and changes nothing in the pipeline.
It fetches pages, measures them, and writes JSON.

    python measure.py                        # the 20 default technologies
    python measure.py fastapi pydantic       # only these
    python measure.py --pages 60             # sample size per technology
    python measure.py --out measurements     # where the JSON lands

Runs are resumable: a technology whose JSON already exists is skipped unless
--force is passed. Network required, and a full run takes a while — it is
meant to be run once and read, not run often.
