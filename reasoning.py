"""
Bounded reasoning: a few model calls at the decisions that determine correctness.

PROPOSAL-II said "No LLM in the per-page loop", and that rule was right. A model
call per page on a 1,200-page site is the huge bill this project exists not to
send. PROPOSAL-3 amends it to say what it always meant: no LLM *in the loop*, a
bounded number of calls *at the decision points*, cached so a decision is made
once per template or per host rather than once per page.

Four moments decide whether a harvest is correct, and all four are settled by
arithmetic today at the exact place the arithmetic is weakest:

  1. a template none of the nine selectors recognise;
  2. kind confidence below threshold on a mandatory kind;
  3. a corpus proposed on a new host — the identity gate confuses *projects*
     with *names*, which is `ISSUES.md` R1 and the top open defect;
  4. a page answering 200 while rendering an error, which no status code shows.

Four properties make spending anything here safe, and they are Invariant 18:

* **Bounded.** `Budget(calls=12)` per harvest, a hard cap. Exhausted means fall
  back, never stall.
* **Cached** by cluster and by host, never by page. A 703-page site with three
  templates spends at most three calls on selectors.
* **Optional.** Off unless `DOCSFORGE_REASONING` is on *and* a provider is
  configured. The zero-key, one-command install is half the product's pitch and
  does not move. Every decision keeps the algorithmic fallback that runs today.
* **Recorded.** Every consultation — question, answer, whether it came from
  cache, whether it failed — lands in `stats["reasoning"]` beside the coverage
  note. A judgement nobody can audit is worse than a heuristic, because a
  heuristic can at least be read.

The arithmetic, stated plainly because "pay a little" has to mean something:
twelve calls at roughly 1,500 tokens in and 100 out is about 20k tokens per
harvest — against a crawl that otherwise fetches and stores a thousand pages.
