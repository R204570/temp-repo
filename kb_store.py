"""
Where harvested documentation lives — the DocsStore.

Three levels, because documentation has three levels:

    technology        effect
      version         v3, v2, or the harvest date when a site is unversioned
        page          Introduction, Error Handling, Layers, …

Keeping versions apart matters: a project's v2 and v3 docs contradict each
other, and a model handed both will happily quote the wrong one. Re-harvesting
a version you already have replaces that version and leaves the others alone.

Two backends behind one interface:

* **files** — `knowledge_base/<tech>/<version>.md`. Zero setup, and the file is
  a deliverable you can hand to anyone.
* **postgres** — a row per page with a GIN-indexed tsvector. Ranked search
  across everything stored, snippets showing why a page matched, and pagination
  that does not load the whole store to count it.

Postgres is used when DOCSFORGE_DB (or DATABASE_URL) is set; files otherwise.

    * **A page is durable before the next is fetched.** Committing per page

      the network, and it means an interrupted harvest keeps what it had.
