docsforge — Universal software documentation → Markdown for LLMs.

Detects what KIND of source it is and extracts accordingly:
  - llms.txt / llms-full.txt      (the LLM-native docs standard)
  - OpenAPI / Swagger (JSON/YAML)  → API reference tables
  - sitemap.xml                    → structured crawl (incl. sitemap indexes)
  - GitHub repo                    → README + /docs via API
  - Generic HTML docs site         → readability extraction
  - Raw Markdown / plaintext       → passthrough + cleanup

    `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` are the reason to prefer publication over
    crawling: a site that publishes them has already produced its *current*
    documentation, complete and LLM-ready, and reading it costs one request
    against a crawl's hundreds. Which is exactly why the two cases divide:

    **No release named** — that published file is precisely what was asked
    for. Take it. This is the pathway worth having, and it stays cheap.

    **A release named** — the published file is the current one, and current
    is not what was asked for. It answers only if it can *show* it is that
    release: by stating so in its header, or by listing pages filed under
    it. Otherwise the version-scoped crawl is the honest answer, because
    storing one release's documentation under another's name is the failure
    the whole version contract exists to prevent.

    Sitting across both: never broaden a scoped request. `docs.modular.com`
    publishes one `llms.txt` for Modular Cloud, so a request for `/mojo/`
    came back as API-key and billing documentation — no release involved,
    just a file about a different product on the same host.
