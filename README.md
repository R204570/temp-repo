**Universal software documentation → clean Markdown for LLMs.**

## 🚀 In production — feedback and contributors can support

**Found a bug, a bad extraction, or something that could work better?**
[Open an issue](https://github.com/R204570/DocsForge/issues) with as much detail
as you can. Every report makes it more reliable.

**Want to contribute?** Email **rajpatel9408019@gmail.com** with the subject
**DocsForge Contribution Proposal**, and include:

- Your **résumé/CV** and **GitHub** — this is what I read to get a picture of your work
- Your experience with crawlers, MCP tools or AI agents
- What you'd like to work on, and any ideas you already have

Useful ground: crawling and scraping, documentation extraction, MCP tools, AI
agents, backend and developer tooling. Bug fixes and documentation count as much
as new crawling strategies.

DocsForge points at any documentation source, figures out *what kind* of source it is, and extracts it into tidy, LLM-ready Markdown. Feed it a docs site, an OpenAPI spec, a GitHub repo, a sitemap, or a raw Markdown file — it detects the format and handles each one appropriately.

It ships in three forms, all sharing one extraction engine:

| Surface | File | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| **CLI** | `docsforge.py` | One-shot scraping into `.md` files. |
| **MCP server** | `mcp_server.py` | Give any MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, your agent) live docs-fetching tools. |
| **Web chat** | `app.py` + `static/` | A chat UI over any of six providers that fetches docs and answers in rendered Markdown, plus DocsStore for browsing what has been harvested. |

```
                   ┌─────────────────┐
   CLI ───────────▶│                 │

                   └─────────────────┘
```

`forge_tools.py` defines each tool exactly once. `mcp_server.py` generates the MCP surface from those definitions; `app.py` hands the same schemas to whichever provider is selected. An MCP client and the web chat therefore run identical code, and neither can drift from the other.

## Features

- **Automatic source detection** — probes the URL (and content, when needed) to pick the right extraction strategy.
- **Supported sources:**
  - `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` — the LLM-native docs standard (passthrough).
  - **OpenAPI / Swagger** (JSON or YAML) → readable API reference with endpoint tables, params, request bodies, and response codes. Local `$ref`s are resolved and path-level parameters are applied to every operation.
  - **sitemap.xml** → structured crawl of every listed page, including sitemap indexes.
  - **GitHub repos** → README + all Markdown under `/docs` via the GitHub API.
  - **Generic HTML docs sites** → readability-style extraction (strips nav/footer/ads, keeps main content).
  - **Raw Markdown / plaintext** → passthrough with cleanup.
- **Bare-domain probing** — auto-checks for `llms.txt` at the root before falling back to HTML.
- **Optional site crawling** (`--crawl`) with same-host link following, page limits, and asset filtering.
- **JS rendering** (`--js`) via Playwright, reusing a single browser across the whole run.
- **Single-file output** (`--single-file`) to concatenate everything into one `.md`.
- **Provenance headers** — every output file records its source URL, type, and scrape time.
- **Durable as it goes** — a page is stored before the next is fetched, so an interrupted crawl keeps what it had, and a page the store refuses costs that page rather than the whole harvest.
- **Concurrent fetching** — pages overlap within a per-host politeness cap, so a crawl waits once instead of once per page, and returns the same pages in the same order a sequential run would.

## Installation

```bash
pipx install docsforge          # the `docsforge` CLI and `docsforge-mcp` server
```

Or from a clone, which is what you want if you intend to change anything:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/R204570/DocsForge.git
cd DocsForge
pip install -e .                # or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional extras, each pulling only what it needs:

```bash
pip install -e ".[web]"         # the chat panel (FastAPI, sanitiser, renderer)
pip install -e ".[postgres]"    # store harvests in Postgres with a text index
pip install -e ".[js]"          # then: playwright install chromium
pip install -e ".[providers]"   # every model SDK; or pick one: [claude], [groq]
pip install -e ".[dev]"         # everything, plus pytest
```

`requirements.txt` is the exact, reproducible set used by CI. `pyproject.toml`
states the version *range* each dependency is known to work across. Four
packages are pinned outright — `beautifulsoup4`, `markdownify`, `mcp` and
`nh3` — because a float in any of them changes extraction, output or
sanitising with no code change of ours.

### As a library

```python
from docsforge import forge, Options

docs = forge("https://docs.example.com", Options(crawl=True, max_pages=10))
for d in docs:
    print(d.title, len(d.markdown))
```

## 2. MCP server

```bash
python mcp_server.py                 # stdio — what MCP clients launch
python mcp_server.py --http          # streamable HTTP on 127.0.0.1:8765
```

Register with Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add docsforge -- python /absolute/path/to/DocsForge/mcp_server.py
```

Or in an MCP client config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docsforge": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["E:/DocsForge/mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools exposed

| Tool | Arguments | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `detect_source_type` | `url` | Which strategy the URL would use — a cheap probe. |
| `fetch_docs` | `url`, `crawl`, `max_pages`, `js`, `force` | The extracted Markdown. |
| `save_docs` | `url`, `out_dir`, `crawl`, `max_pages`, `js`, `force`, `single_file` | Paths written to disk. |
| `harvest_docs` | `url`, `name`, `max_pages`, `js`, `scope`, `version` | Learns a whole technology from one URL and stores it. Unlimited by default. Returns a summary. |
| `learn_technology` | `name`, `version`, `ecosystem`, `max_pages`, `js`, `intent`, `corpora`, `strict` | **Learns a library from its name alone — no URL.** Resolves, verifies, harvests, stores. |
| `find_docs` | `name`, `ecosystem` | Where a name resolves to, with evidence. Harvests nothing. |
| `scan_project` | `path`, `unknown_only` | A project's dependencies, versions, and which are documented. |
| `search_knowledge_base` | `query`, `technology`, `version`, `limit` | Ranked search across every stored page at once. |
| `list_knowledge_base` | — | What has already been harvested, and which versions of each. |
| `read_knowledge_base` | `name`, `section`, `version` | Reads stored docs back, optionally only matching pages. Defaults to the newest version. |
| `forget_resolution` | `name` | Forgets where a name previously resolved to, so the next lookup starts over. Deletes no documentation. Omit `name` to clear all. |
| `forget_selection` | `name` | Forgets which corpora were chosen for a technology, so it asks again. Deletes no documentation. |

`learn_technology` also takes `intent`, `corpora` and `strict`; `search_knowledge_base`
takes `kind`. See **Serving a purpose** below.

`forget_documentation` also exists but is opt-in behind `DOCSFORGE_ALLOW_DELETE=1`:
deleting a harvest is the one irreversible thing here, and a model that has just
mis-resolved a name is not the caller you want holding that lever.

Results handed to a model are capped at `DOCSFORGE_MAX_CHARS` (60k default) with an explicit truncation marker.

## 3. Web chat

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # add a key for ONE provider — or none at all
python app.py             # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Three surfaces, one window: the chat at `/`, **DocsStore** at `/library`, and
everything that would otherwise need explaining at `/docs`. Charcoal on black
with a single accent; nothing on the home screen but the input.

The sidebar opens with the panel button or `Ctrl`+`B`, and holds your past
conversations. They live in your browser — forty most recent, Markdown only,
nothing uploaded — so **New chat** no longer throws work away.

Every tool call the model makes is listed above the answer it produced — what
was fetched, what kind of source it was, and how much came back — so an answer
built from a page that was actually read does not look like one that was not.
Each answer carries **Copy / Download .md / Edit**, because the Markdown is
something you keep, not just something you read. The send button becomes a stop
button while an answer streams, and stopping keeps what already arrived.

### Providers

Pick one from the model control at the top right; unconfigured ones are
disabled and say why. The choice rides on each request, so when one provider
hits its daily cap you switch and keep going mid-conversation.

| Provider | Key | Default model | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | *none* | your CLI default | Runs the local `claude` CLI against your existing login. **No API key and no per-token bill.** |
| **Ollama** | *none* | best installed | Models running on your own machine. **No key, no quota, works offline.** |
| **Claude** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `claude-opus-5` | Strongest on long documents and tool use. |
| **Groq** | `GROQ_API_KEY` | `gpt-oss-120b` | Fast and cheap; free tier caps at 100k tokens/day. |
| **ChatGPT** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-4.1` | Billed per token, no free tier. |
| **Gemini** | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Large free tier. |

Each provider is one file in `providers/`, and they all speak the same small
event stream (`text`, `tool_start`, `tool_end`, `notice`) so `app.py` never
learns which one is running. What differs is the tool-calling shape, which is
why each owns its own loop:

- `groq.py` and `chatgpt.py` share `_openai_shape.py` — `tool_calls` deltas
  stitched by index, answered with `role: "tool"` messages.
- `claude.py` — `tool_use` blocks answered by `tool_result` blocks in one user
  turn. Sends **no** `temperature`/`top_p`/`top_k`: they were removed on Opus 5
  and return a 400. Refusal fallbacks are on by default (`ANTHROPIC_FALLBACKS=off`).
- `gemini.py` — `functionCall` / `functionResponse` parts, automatic function
  calling disabled so the JSON-Schema tool definitions stay shared.
- `ollama.py` — reuses the same OpenAI-shaped loop (Ollama serves an
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint), but probes the daemon instead of checking for a
  key, and auto-picks the best tool-capable model you have pulled. Models that
  cannot call tools — embeddings, `phi3`, vision-only — are filtered out, since
  one that silently answers from memory looks like DocsForge being broken.
- `claudecode.py` — the odd one out: it shells out to the `claude` CLI with
  **DocsForge's own MCP server attached**, so the tools run out of process over
  real MCP. `--strict-mcp-config` keeps your other MCP servers out of the session.

Adding a provider means one file and one line in `providers/__init__.py`.

### Configuration

Everything is optional; see `.env.example` for the full list.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DOCSFORGE_PROVIDER` | first configured | Which provider to start on. |
| `<NAME>_MODEL` | per provider | Override a provider's model, e.g. `CLAUDE_MODEL`. |
| `ANTHROPIC_FALLBACKS` | `default` | `off` disables Claude's server-side refusal fallbacks. |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | — | Point ChatGPT at Azure or an OpenAI-compatible host. |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` | Where the Ollama daemon listens. |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | auto | Pin a local model; otherwise the best tool-capable one installed. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | — | Raises the GitHub API rate limit. |
| `DOCSFORGE_MAX_CHARS` | `60000` | Largest tool result returned to a model. |
| `DOCSFORGE_OUT_ROOT` | `./docs_md` | Directory `save_docs` may write into. |
| `DOCSFORGE_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | unset | Allow fetching private/loopback addresses. |
| `DOCSFORGE_ALLOW_DELETE` | unset | Let the **model** delete stored documentation. Off by default — see below. |
| `DOCSFORGE_REASONING` | `off` | Allow a bounded number of model calls at four decision points — see below. |

### Removing a harvest

A harvest can be wrong: the wrong project, a partial copy, a table of contents
stored as though it were the documentation. Three ways to take one back out.

**In DocsStore.** Open a technology at `/library` and each version has a delete
control, with a second one below for the whole technology. It asks once before
acting.

**From the command line**, which is the one to reach for when clearing several:

```bash
python docsforge.py --forget pydantic@1.10     # one version
python docsforge.py --forget astro             # every version of it
python docsforge.py --forget a --forget b --yes  # several, no prompt
```

It prints what it is about to remove — pages and characters — and does nothing
unless you type `yes` or pass `--yes`.

**Over HTTP**, which is what the UI uses:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/library/astro
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/library/pydantic/1.10
```

**Can the model delete?** Not unless you say so. Deleting is the one
irreversible thing DocsForge does, and a model that has just mis-resolved a
name is the last caller who should hold that lever — 703 pages of Effect are
one confident hallucination away. Set `DOCSFORGE_ALLOW_DELETE=1` to add a
`forget_documentation` tool to the surface. Note that you do not need it to
re-harvest: harvesting the same name again replaces that version on its own.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | The chat UI. |
| `GET` | `/docs` | How it all works. (Swagger UI is disabled so this URL is the product's; the schema is still at `/openapi.json`.) |
| `GET` | `/library` | DocsStore: everything harvested so far. |
| `GET` | `/api/config` | Provider catalog, current default, tool list. |
| `POST` | `/api/chat` | SSE stream: `token`, `tool`, `notice`, `done`, `error`. Takes an optional `provider`. |
| `POST` | `/api/render` | Markdown → sanitized HTML. |
| `GET` | `/api/library` | One page of technologies. `?page=N&q=filter`. |
| `GET` | `/api/library/{tech}` | Every stored version of one technology. |
| `GET` | `/api/library/{tech}/{version}` | That version's page index. |
| `GET` | `/api/library/{tech}/{version}/page/{n}` | One page, as Markdown and sanitized HTML. |
| `GET` | `/api/library-search` | Ranked search. `?q=&tech=&version=&limit=`. |

The server is stateless — the browser holds the conversation and posts it back each turn.

## DocsStore

`/library` is the box: every documentation set that has ever been harvested,
three levels deep.

```
effect                  a divider in the box
  v3, v2                every crawled version of it
    703 pages           the pages of the version you opened
```

The technology list is **paged** (12 at a time) rather than loaded whole,
because the box grows every time anyone harvests and there is no natural
ceiling. Opening a divider lists every version with its page count, size,
harvest date and strategy; opening a version puts its page index beside the
page you are reading. The search box inside a version runs the ranked
full-text search over that version only, and marks what matched.

Every view is addressable, so a link goes exactly where you meant:
`/library#/effect/v3/41`.

The menu bar's right-hand corner names the backend that answered. That is not
decoration: a Postgres box ranks search and a file box cannot, and reading
unranked results while believing they are ranked is worse than knowing.

## Learning something by name

The caller usually does not have a documentation URL — it is a model that has
just met a library it does not know, so *where the docs live* is exactly the
knowledge it is missing. It does not need one:

```
learn_technology(name="effect")
learn_technology(name="pydantic", version="1.10")
  -> resolved to https://docs.pydantic.dev (names 'pydantic' 214 times)
  -> harvested 85 pages, stored as pydantic 1.10
```

It asks the package registries — npm, PyPI, crates.io, all keyless — where the
library declares its documentation, probes the site for an `llms.txt` or a docs
root, and then **confirms the page actually documents that package** before
harvesting anything.

### How a name is resolved

A bounded ladder, cheapest lap first. Every lap ends at the same identity gate,
so reaching further never means believing more:

| Lap | What it tries |
|---|---|
| **memory** | A resolution seen in the last 30 days. Costs zero requests. Refusals are re-tried after 7 days, because a site can add the evidence later. |
| **domain** | `{name}.dev` / `.io` / `.org` / `.com`, and the docs root beneath whichever answers. |
| **registries** | Exact-name lookup in npm, PyPI and crates.io. |
| **name shapes** | For multi-word names: `opentelemetry.io`, `airflow.apache.org`, `tanstack.com/query`, `docs.spring.io/spring-boot`. |
| **search** | npm and crates.io fuzzy search, then `DOCSFORGE_SEARCH` if you configure one. Never a search engine's HTML. |

The whole ladder is capped at 40 requests and 20 seconds, so a name that does
not exist refuses promptly instead of wandering.

```bash
forget_resolution(name="polars")   # resolved to the wrong site? start over
forget_resolution()                # clear every remembered lookup
```

### Verification is the point

A resolver that is merely usually right is a slower guess. Names collide: the
npm package `fastapi` is unrelated to the Python framework, and the `effect`
crate is not the TypeScript library. Harvesting an unverified page stores the
wrong project and then answers from it confidently.

So a page must name the package repeatedly before it is trusted — one passing
mention is noise. If nothing verifies, DocsForge reports that and asks for a
URL instead of picking something plausible. `find_docs` shows the candidates
and the evidence without fetching the documentation.

### Reading the project

`scan_project` reads `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`,
`Cargo.toml` and `go.mod`, and reports each dependency, its version, and
whether it is documented here yet.

The manifest is the only place the **correct version** can be read from. A bare
name cannot tell you this project is pinned to Pydantic 1.10, and 1.10 and 2.11
contradict each other — which is what the versioned store exists to prevent,
and what a name-only lookup would defeat.

### Names are matched, not memorised

`Effect.ts`, `effect-ts` and `effect` all reach the same stored copy, and
`@scope/pkg` files under `pkg`. Everything is stored under one canonical name,
so a library cannot end up saved twice under two spellings. Genuinely ambiguous
names are refused rather than guessed.

## Learning a whole technology

`fetch_docs` answers "extract this URL". `harvest_docs` answers "extract this
technology" — the question you actually have when a model does not know a stack:

```
harvest_docs(url="https://www.effect.website/docs/v3/getting-started/introduction/")
  -> 200 pages, 2,668,643 characters, stored as knowledge_base/effect.md
```

Give it any page of a docs site and it finds the rest, best strategy first:

1. **`llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`** — the site already published itself for machines.
2. **`sitemap.xml`**, filtered to the docs section — complete, cheap, and it finds
   pages nothing links to. Located via `robots.txt` first, then the usual paths.
3. **A scoped crawl** — works anywhere, but only reaches what is linked.

Everything lands as one Markdown file with a contents index, and
`read_knowledge_base(name, section=...)` reads it back so a stored technology is
never re-scraped to answer a question. `section` matches page titles first and
falls back to searching the text, so a specific question pulls the handful of
relevant pages instead of a whole manual.

### How much it crawls

`harvest_docs` has **no page limit by default** — it keeps going until the
documentation section is exhausted. A page count is a guess at how big someone
else's manual is; the scope prefix above is the boundary that actually means
something. The Effect v3 docs come to 703 pages, and nothing in DocsForge knew
that in advance.

Pass `max_pages=N` only to deliberately cut a harvest short. `fetch_docs` keeps
its own 200-page ceiling, so a single page fetch can never turn into an
open-ended crawl by accident.

### A long harvest does not block

The Effect v3 docs take around twelve minutes to harvest. Every MCP client
gives up long before that, so `learn_technology` used to look broken on exactly
the technologies it was most needed for.

It now waits up to 25 seconds (`DOCSFORGE_HARVEST_DEADLINE`) and then hands
back a harvest id while the crawl carries on in the background:

```
**Learning effect from https://effect.website/docs/ — still running.** Harvest id `effect-1`.

Currently harvesting 118/703 pages, 25s elapsed.
```

`list_knowledge_base` reports every harvest in flight, and any that failed —
a background failure leaves no other trace, so it is surfaced there rather
than lost. Anything that finishes inside the deadline returns exactly what it
always returned; short harvests are unaffected.

Jobs live in the server process and are not persisted. The durable record of a
harvest is the knowledge-base entry it writes, so a harvest interrupted by a
restart simply did not happen.

### A short harvest says so

When you *do* set a limit and hit it, that is reported — in the harvest result,
in `list_knowledge_base`, and again every time the content is read:

```
**INCOMPLETE — stopped at the 200-page limit, 400+ pages still queued.**
```

That matters more than the limit itself: a third of a manual that looks whole
produces confident, wrong answers.

### Versions are kept apart

A library's v2 and v3 docs contradict each other, and a model handed both will
quote the wrong one. So a harvest is filed under a **version**, not just a
name, and re-harvesting one version leaves the others alone:

```
pydantic
  2.11   85 pages   1.2 MB   harvested 2026-08-14
  1.10   24 pages   198 KB   harvested 2026-08-14
```

The label comes from the URL — `/docs/v3/`, `/docs/validation/2.11/` — and is
then **checked against what came back**. A site publishes one `llms.txt` for
its current release, so if the harvest served that instead of crawling the
version you asked for, the label falls back to the harvest date rather than
claiming a precision the content does not have. Sites that publish one version
at a time are always dated: the date says which snapshot this is.

`read_knowledge_base(name, version=...)` picks one; without it you get the most
recently harvested.

For the same reason the crawl scope follows the version down the path.
Pydantic keeps versions at `/docs/validation/2.11/`, and stopping at `/docs/`
there crawls every version of the manual at once and calls the result one
harvest.

### Where harvested docs live

Two backends, chosen automatically:

| | When | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **Markdown files** | the default | `knowledge_base/<tech>/<version>.md`, one file per version, plus `index.json`. Zero setup, and the file is a deliverable you can hand to anyone. |
| **PostgreSQL** | `DOCSFORGE_DB` set and reachable | A row per page with a GIN-indexed `tsvector`. Section lookups are ranked and stay fast as the store grows, and several DocsForge instances can share one store. |

```bash
DOCSFORGE_DB=postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/DocsForge
```

The schema is created on first use. If the database is unreachable DocsForge
falls back to files rather than losing a harvest — losing ten minutes of
crawling to a database outage would be the worse failure.

The file path is anchored to the package directory rather than the working
directory: keying it off `cwd` meant launching the app from elsewhere silently
produced a second, empty knowledge base. Override with `DOCSFORGE_KB_ROOT`.
Both `knowledge_base/` and `.env` are gitignored.

Postgres is what makes `section=` worth using. The file backend answers it by
regex over one large string, which cannot rank; Postgres ranks, with page
titles weighted above body text. Over 703 harvested Effect pages (6.3 MB):

```
'error handling'                  0.20s   1 page   (by title)
'retry with exponential backoff'  0.11s   6 pages  (by content, ranked)
```

Already have a file store? `tests/migrate_kb.py` reads the combined Markdown
back into Postgres, so a site that took ten minutes to crawl is not crawled
again.

To read what is stored, open [DocsStore](#docsstore) at `/library`.

### Why the crawl is scoped

Documentation shares a domain with marketing, blogs and changelogs. Crawling by
host from an Effect docs page reached `/podcast` and `/community-hub` within four
pages, and those pages then dominated the truncated result the model saw — so it
summarised a podcast feed instead of the library.

`harvest_docs` therefore stays inside the *documentation root* of the start URL
(`/docs/v3/getting-started/introduction/` -> `/docs/v3/`), which took that same
crawl from 7/12 relevant pages to 200/200. Pass `scope="host"` for the old
behaviour, or a literal prefix like `scope="/docs/v3/"` to pin it exactly.

## Measuring the crawler

`instrument.py` measures what extraction actually does — which `CONTENT`
selector won on each page, how often none did and `<body>` was stored whole,
how many distinct templates a site really has, how much of the "documentation"
is link text, and how many pages are JS shells. It decides nothing and no
shipping module imports it; a test enforces both.

`measure.py` drives it across real technologies and writes the numbers out:

```bash
python measure.py                     # the built-in 20, ~40 pages each
python measure.py fastapi --pages 6   # one technology, quickly
```

Results land in `measurements/` as JSON plus a readable table, and the run is
resumable. This exists because every adaptive rule the crawler runs is a
threshold over a number, and thresholds picked before the numbers are guesses.

## Serving a purpose

A technology of any size documents itself in more than one place: a manual, a
specification, a generated API reference, often on different hosts. DocsForge
finds those from the link evidence it gathers while crawling, confirms each new
host through the same identity gate it uses for resolution, and classifies them
by **shape** (how to fetch it) and **kind** (what it is for).

`intent` then decides which enter scope:

| Intent | Takes | Leaves |
|---|---|---|
| `resolve-import` | `api`, `sdk` | guides, cookbooks, changelogs |
| `implement` | `api`, plus guides and examples | changelogs, meta |
| `learn` | `guide`, plus language and spec | changelogs, meta |
| `operate` | `operations`, plus guides and API | meta |
| `reference` *(default)* | everything except `meta` | — |

Two rules keep this honest:

- **Corpora left out are declared, never dropped.** Each is listed with its
  size and marked `not requested`.
- **Choosing a corpus is scope; dropping pages inside one is filtering, and is
  forbidden.** A selected corpus is harvested whole or reported partial.

When several corpora could be what you meant, it does not guess — it returns
`NEEDS SELECTION` with the options, and remembers your answer so the question is
asked once. `forget_selection` clears it.

```python
learn_technology(name="stripe", intent="resolve-import", strict=True)
```

`strict=True` adds `usable_for_planning`, which is `true` only when every corpus
your intent requires came back complete. It is the figure a downstream system
can refuse to act on.

## Answering from what is stored

`search_knowledge_base` returns **passages**, not pages. Results are chunked on
`h2`/`h3` and ranked as sections, each carrying its heading path so you can cite
it — `Error Handling > Retrying` rather than "somewhere on the retry page". One
page of a generated API reference can be 20,000 tokens spent answering a
one-line question.

```python
search_knowledge_base(query="exponential backoff", kind="api")
```

`kind` keeps tutorial prose out of an answer that wants a signature. Relevance
is applied at read time only: what is stored stays whole, and only what is
handed back is narrowed.

## Reasoning, if you want it

Four moments decide whether a harvest is correct, and all four are settled by
arithmetic at exactly the point the arithmetic is weakest: a template none of
the nine selectors recognise, a corpus whose kind the URL does not state, a new
host that may be a different project sharing a name, and a page answering 200
while rendering an error.

`DOCSFORGE_REASONING=on` lets a model settle those instead — under a budget
that is the whole point of the feature:

- **Twelve calls per harvest.** A hard cap, not a target. Spent means fall back,
  never stall.
- **Cached per template and per host, never per page.** A 700-page site with
  three templates costs at most three calls. There is no per-page model call
  anywhere, by construction — that is the bill this design exists to avoid.
- **Validated before trusted.** A proposed selector that matches nothing on the
  page is discarded, and the algorithmic answer stands.
- **Only ever stricter at the identity gate.** A host the gate refused is never
  re-admitted by asking; reasoning can veto a wrong admission and cannot create
  one.
- **Recorded.** Every consultation, its question and its answer appear in the
  result beside the coverage note. A judgement nobody can audit is worse than a
  heuristic.

It needs a configured provider as well as the flag, and with it off every path
behaves exactly as it does without it — which is what the test suite runs.

## Known limits

Kept here rather than only in `Project Development/AUDIT.md`, because a tool
whose pitch is calibrated confidence cannot be selective about its own.

- **Multi-word names resolve about 8 times in 20**, up from 1 before the name-shape
  lap. `apache airflow`, `ruby on rails`, `open telemetry`, `shadcn ui` and
  `visual studio code` now work. `spring boot`, `next auth`, `framer motion`,
  `aws lambda` and the cloud-provider names still refuse — several for honest
  reasons, such as documentation living under a deep path on an enormous vendor
  portal that no name shape reaches. Refusing beats guessing.
- **A resolved name is not always the right project.** Verification confirms a
  page is *about something with that name*, which is not the same as confirming
  the project. A new `repo-identity` signal fixed the worst cases — `django` no
  longer reaches an npm placeholder and `serde` no longer reaches a same-named
  Python package — but a domain that owns the word and repeats it is still
  enough. `flask` reaches an unrelated to-do app at flask.io, `polars` reaches a
  third-party site, and `github actions` reaches a parked page at
  githubactions.com. Check the URL in the result before trusting a harvest, pass
  `ecosystem=` when you know it, and use `forget_resolution` when it is wrong.
  See `Project Development/FINDINGS-B.md` and `Project Development/FINDINGS-C.md`.
- **A page under an unrecognised template is refused, not stored.** Extraction
  tries nine selectors and then scores the page by text-to-link density; where
  nothing reads like documentation it stores nothing and says so, rather than
  silently keeping the navigation. That is the right default — it is what
  stopped a sidebar being filed as a manual — but it costs a real page whenever
  an API reference is mostly method links. Bounded reasoning can propose a
  selector for such a template, validated against the page before it is used.
- **A page that answers 200 while rendering an error can still be stored.** A
  4xx or 5xx is refused outright, but a *soft* 404 — a genuine 200 whose body
  reads "Page not found" — is indistinguishable from documentation without
  reading it. Bounded reasoning catches these when it is switched on; with it
  off, they are stored.
- **An interrupted harvest leaves nothing readable.** Pages are durable as they
  are fetched, and whatever was already stored is untouched — but a harvest
  that never finished stays invisible until it does, rather than being served
  as a partial copy. That is deliberate: a partial corpus presented as a whole
  one is the failure this project exists to refuse. Whether it should be
  readable behind an explicit opt-in is an open question.
- **Background harvests do not survive a restart.** The pages do — they are
  written as they are fetched — but the *report* of a running harvest is
  in-process, so a killed process loses track of it.

`Project Development/` holds the design record: three proposals, an audit, and
the measurements behind each threshold. `PROPOSAL-II.md` (federation, intent,
passages) and `PROPOSAL-3.md` (streaming storage, measured shape, concurrency,
bounded reasoning) are both implemented; `ISSUES.md` is the live list of what is
still open, including every limit above.

## Security

DocsForge fetches URLs chosen by whoever is talking to it, which in the MCP and web paths can be a language model. Two guards apply there:

- **SSRF** — requests to private, loopback, link-local, and reserved addresses are refused. Set `DOCSFORGE_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1` (or pass `--allow-private`) to scrape docs on your own network.
- **Path traversal** — `save_docs` cannot write outside `DOCSFORGE_OUT_ROOT`.

Rendered Markdown is sanitized with `nh3` before it reaches the page, since it mixes model output with scraped HTML. Bind `app.py` to `127.0.0.1` (the default) unless you have put authentication in front of it.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q          # 611 offline unit tests, no network

# The 37 Postgres tests skip unless you point them at a throwaway database,
# which makes a green run look more complete than it is — set this before
# trusting one. The variable is deliberately NOT DOCSFORGE_DB, and the database
# it names must not be the one holding real harvests: these tests create and
# drop technologies.
DOCSFORGE_TEST_DB=postgresql://postgres:pw@127.0.0.1:5432/DocsForgeTest python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

The live checks need the network, and the last two need `GROQ_API_KEY`:

```bash
python tests/smoke_mcp.py           # spawns the MCP server over stdio
python app.py --port 8123 &
python tests/smoke_web.py 8123      # one real Groq turn, end to end
python tests/smoke_multiturn.py 8123
python tests/shoot_ui.py 8123       # screenshots every UI state
```

`shoot_ui.py` stubs the model stream by default, so it costs no tokens and is
deterministic; pass `--live` to drive a real turn instead.

## Output

By default, each source produces its own Markdown file in the output directory, named from the host, path, and a short hash of the URL — so pages from different sites never overwrite each other. Every file starts with a comment header noting the source URL, detected type, and timestamp. Use `--single-file` to merge all documents into one file separated by horizontal rules.
