"""A background harvest has to be visible from outside the process running it.

The defect these were written from: `learn_technology` started a harvest in the
MCP subprocess the `claudecode` provider launches, told the user that
`list_knowledge_base()` would report it, and that call ran in a different
process which had never heard of the job. Nothing anywhere showed progress —
not the panel, not the log, not the tool — and then the documentation appeared
in DocsStore some minutes later as though from nowhere.
