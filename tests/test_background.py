"""
Offline tests for background harvesting (F7).

The defect: `learn_technology` blocked for as long as the harvest took, so a
703-page site timed out every MCP client and the headline tool read as broken.
The fix must hold two things at once, and each test below pins one of them:

  * a harvest that finishes quickly behaves exactly as it always did, and
  * a harvest that does not still returns promptly, keeps running, and is
    reported afterwards rather than lost.

No network and no real crawling: `_resolve` and `tool_harvest_docs` are stubbed,
because what is under test is who waits for the harvest, not the harvest.
