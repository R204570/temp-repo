"""
Tests for PROPOSAL-3 Phase 2 — the coverage a reader actually sees.

Two wiring defects with the same shape: PROPOSAL-II built the honest answer,
tested it, and then showed the reader a different one.

  * **W1** — `Federation.complete` implements Invariant 9 and nothing called it.
    A harvest that got all of one corpus and half of another announced itself
    complete in its headline, with the shortfall visible only to a reader who
    scrolled to the note at the bottom.
  * **W4** — the entry corpus, already crawled and already stored, could be
    reported **"not requested"**, because `classify_kind` returns `""` for a
    docs root with no kind token in its path and an unclassified corpus matches
    no kind-specific intent.

Both are about the same failure: the summary contradicting the detail. A reader
who trusts the headline is the reader this product is for.
