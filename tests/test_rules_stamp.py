"""`RULES` has to move when the rules do, and relying on memory did not work.

The stamp exists so a fix reaches the cache: an entry decided under superseded
rules is evidence about the code that wrote it, not about the name, so `recall`
discards it. It works. What failed is the handle.

PR #9 changed how a winner is chosen — read every candidate and rank them by
what their signals mean — and left `RULES` at 1. A cache holding
`langchain -> reference.langchain.com` at `rules: 1` therefore still matched,
`recall` served it in one second, and the new ranking never ran. The fix
shipped and reached nobody.

So the reminder is a test rather than a comment. It fingerprints the functions
that actually decide an answer, ignoring comments and docstrings so that
rewording is free. If the fingerprint moves, either bump `RULES` and update
`FINGERPRINT` below, or explain in review why an answer decided by the new code
is still interchangeable with one decided by the old.
