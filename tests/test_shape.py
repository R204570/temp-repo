"""
Tests for PROPOSAL-3 Phase 2 — shape and magnitude, measured rather than assumed.

`classify_shape` and `Corpus.magnitude` were built and tested under PROPOSAL-II
and never called (`ISSUES.md` W2, W3). The consequence was not cosmetic: with
every corpus classified `tree`, the `page` branch of `_harvest_corpus` was
unreachable, so a specification published as one enormous document got crawled
as a site, found one page, and — being one 1.19 MB page — stored nothing. That
is S7, and it is the second half of the `go.dev` failure.

So these tests come in two halves, and the second half is the one that would
have caught the original bug:

  * that `classify_shape` decides correctly given measurements, and
  * that something actually measures, and actually calls it.
