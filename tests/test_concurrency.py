"""
Tests for PROPOSAL-3 Phase 3 — bounded concurrency.

Fetching is almost all of a crawl's wall-clock time and almost none of its CPU.
`go.dev` spent sixteen minutes on roughly 1,200 pages, which is most of a second
per page spent waiting on the network with one connection open.

The phase's acceptance criterion is deliberately two-sided, because either half
alone is easy and worthless: **at least 2x faster, and the same page set as the
sequential run.** A crawler that is fast because it drops pages is not faster.
