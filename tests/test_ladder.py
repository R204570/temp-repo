"""
Offline tests for the Phase C resolution ladder — no network.

The ladder's whole claim is that more laps never mean a lower bar. Every lap
therefore gets two tests: one that it can now reach something it could not
reach before, and one that a candidate it reaches still has to pass exactly the
same identity gate. A lap that resolves more names by believing more of them
would be a regression dressed as a feature.
