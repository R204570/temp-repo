"""
Offline tests for Phase F selection — no network.

Two properties carry this layer, and both are easy to erode later:

  * **Invariant 4.** Choosing which corpora enter scope is a declaration that
    gets recorded. Dropping pages inside a selected corpus is filtering and is
    forbidden. Once `intent` exists, every future request to "just skip the
    irrelevant pages" will sound reasonable.
  * **Invariant 10.** When it cannot tell what is needed it asks, and if it
    cannot ask it refuses and returns the options. It never guesses, because a
    silently truncated harvest that looks successful is worse than a refusal.
