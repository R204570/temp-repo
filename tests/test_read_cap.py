"""What the read cap bounds, and — more importantly — what it does not.

`MAX_CHARS` caps one tool result. It was 60,000, which cut real documentation
short: a single large specification page is bigger than that, and being handed
a third of one is a poor answer to a question about it.

The reason it cannot simply be removed is the *provider's* context window, not
DocsForge's storage. A result that overflows a window does not truncate
gracefully, it fails the turn — and this project speaks to six providers, some
with far smaller windows than Claude's.
