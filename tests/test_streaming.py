"""
Tests for PROPOSAL-3 Phase 1 — storage that streams.

Two invariants carry this phase, and both were paid for in a real failure:
`go.dev` crawled for sixteen minutes, met one 1.19 MB page, and stored none of
the ~1,200 that had extracted cleanly.

  * **Invariant 16** — a page is durable before the next is fetched.
  * **Invariant 17** — a failed page costs one page. Never the batch, never the
    harvest, and never the version already stored.

The Postgres tests are the ones that matter for Invariant 17, because the file
store refuses nothing. They are gated on `DOCSFORGE_TEST_DB` like the rest.
