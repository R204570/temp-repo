"""A harvest must outlive the turn that asked for it, and three tries were wrong.

The stdio MCP server is launched per turn by the `claude` CLI and torn down
with it. Measured, in order:

    1. wait before exiting     close-stdin  lived 232s   stored: 1.0.0.md
                               kill         lived   2s   stored: NOTHING
    2. spawn DETACHED_PROCESS  detached only          tick 4 -> 4   DIED
                               detached + breakaway   never started  DIED
    3. hand it to the server                                        works

A client tears its children down by closing their **job object**, and Windows
kills every process in a job with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` however
detached. `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` is refused unless the job grants it, and
the child then fails to start at all. No spawn flag wins that argument, so the
work has to *begin* somewhere the job never reached — the long-lived DocsForge
server, which is also where background harvests have always worked.
