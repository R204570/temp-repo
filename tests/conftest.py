"""
Shared test setup.

`app.py` calls load_dotenv() at import time, so importing it in a test pulls the
developer's real .env into os.environ for the rest of the session — including
DOCSFORGE_DB. That silently pointed the knowledge-base tests at a live database
instead of a temporary one.

Tests therefore run with the production storage variables stripped, and opt into
a real database explicitly through DOCSFORGE_TEST_DB.
