Integration tests for execution-trace observability: forge_tools.run_tool()
through to the real tool functions, and app.py's SSE surface.

Unlike tests/test_tracing.py (the trace log in isolation), these drive the
actual instrumented call paths -- tool_learn_technology, tool_harvest_docs,
run_tool's dispatch -- with the network stubbed out, the same way
tests/test_learn.py already does for the tools themselves.
