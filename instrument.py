"""
Measuring a page from raw HTML, and what a resolution attempt revealed.

Phase B of PROPOSAL-II. Every adaptive rule the crawler applies is a threshold
over a number, and writing those rules first would mean guessing the constants
and then discovering, expensively, which guesses were wrong. So this measures.

The record types themselves live in `observation.py`, which imports nothing
from the pipeline — that is what lets the crawler adapt on them. This module
needs `docsforge` to do the measuring, so anything the crawler must reach
cannot live here.

`Budget` and `ResolveState` are Layer 1's, and the resolver consumes them
directly. `observe()` is the driver's, and the pipeline has its own cheaper
path that reports from the parse it already did rather than re-parsing.

    Two parses, on purpose: `strip_chrome` removes `<script>`, so shell
    detection has to read the document before stripping. Measuring the stripped
    copy for everything else is what keeps these numbers honest — they describe
    the text that would actually be stored, not the raw page.

    The crawler does *not* call this. It reports from the parse it already did
    (`docsforge._html_to_md(report=...)`), because paying for a second parse of
