"""
Execution-trace observability: a small, best-effort event log for what a
DocsForge tool call is actually doing underneath, so the Web UI can show
more than "tool running / tool finished".

This is a REPORTING layer over execution that already happens elsewhere --
forge_tools.py's orchestration, docsforge.py's harvest ladder, resolver.py,
kb_store.py. It never decides what work to do, and a failure in it must
never break the work it is describing: every mutating method here swallows
its own exceptions.

A Trace is one tool call's story: a flat, ordered, thread-safe log of
TraceEvents, each naming its parent so a browser can render
Turn -> tool call -> stage -> event without this module knowing anything
about turns or tool calls. Traces live in this process only -- the same
policy harvest_jobs.Job already uses -- and are pruned once there are more
finished ones than KEEP_FINISHED.

Deliberately named `tracing`, not `trace`: the standard library already
owns that name (python -m trace), and shadowing it is not worth the
confusion the first time someone reaches for it in a debugger.
